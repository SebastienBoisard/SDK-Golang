Recast.AI official SDK in Golang.
Package documentation: https://godoc.org/github.com/RecastAI/SDK-Golang/recast

## Synospis

This module is a Golang interface to the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) API. It allows you to make request to your bots

## Installation


```bash
go get -t github.com/RecastAI/SDK-golang/recast
```

## Usage

### Module

```go
import "github.com/RecastAI/SDK-Golang/recast"

func main() {
	client := recast.NewClient(YOUR_TOKEN, "en")

    response, err := client.TextRequest(YOUR_TEXT, nil)
    if err != nil {
            // Handle error
    }

    intent, err := response.Intent()
    if err != nil {
            // No intent found
    } else if intent == YOUR_INTENT {
        // Do your code...
    }
}
```

## Specs

### Structs

This module contains 4 main structures, as follows:

* Client is the client allowing you to make requests.
* Response contains the response from [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai).
* Sentence represents a sentence of the response.
* Entity represents an entity found by Recast.AI in your user's input.

Don't hesitate to dive into the code, it's commented ;)

### Client

The Recast.AI Client can be instanciated with a token and provides the two following methods:

* textRequest(text string, opts map[string]string) *Performs a text request*
* fileRequest(file string, opts map[string]string) *Performs a voice file request*

*Accepted options are "token" to override the token of the client, and language, to specify the language of the input*

```go
import "github.com/RecastAI/SDK-Golang/recast"

func main() {
    var client *recast.Client
    var response *recast.Response

    client = &recast.Client{}

    response, err := client.FileRequest(YOUR_VOICE_FILE, map[string]string {
		"token": YOUR_TOKEN,
		"language": "en",
	})
    if err != nil {
		// Handle error
    }
}
```

### Response

The Recast.AI Response is generated after a call with the two previous methods and contains the following methods:
* Languages() *Returns the language of the input*
* Sentence()  *Returns the first detected sentence*
* Sentences() *Returns all sentences detected in the input*
* Intent()    *Returns the first matched intent*
* Intents() *Returns all intents detected, ordered by propability*
* Status() *Returns the status of the response*
* Timestamp() *Returns the timestamp of the request *
* Version() *Returns the version of the json*
* Entity(name string) *Returns the first entity matching -name-*
* Entities(name string) *Returns all entities matching -names-*
* AllEntities(names ...string) *Returns all entities matching -names-*

```go
response, err := client.TextRequest("Give me a recipe with asparagus. And a recipe with tomatoes.")
if err != nil {
// Handle error
}

intent, err := response.Intent()
if err != nil {
// No intent matches input
}

if intent == "recipe" {
	var entitiesMap map[string][]*recast.Entity
    var ingredients []*recast.Entity

    // get all 'ingredients' entities
    entitiesMap = response.AllEntities()
    ingredients = response.Entities("ingredients")
}
fmt.Printf("This request has been filled at %s\n", response.Timestamp())
```

### Sentence

The Recast.AI Sentence is generated by the Recast.AI Response constructor and provides the following methods:

* Source() *The source of the sentence*
* Type() *The type of the sentence*
* Action() *The action of the sentence*
* Agent() *The agent of the sentence*
* Polarity() *The polarity (negation or not) of the sentence*
* Entities() *All the entities detected in the sentence*
* Entities(name string) *Returns a slice of entities of type -name-*
* AllEntities(names ...string) *Returns a all entities matching one of -names-*

```go
resp, err := client.TextRequest("Tell me a joke.")
if err != nil {
	// Handle error
}
sentence := resp.Sentence()
if sentence.Action() == "tell" && sentence.Polarity() == "positive" {
	// Tell a joke...
}
```

### Entity

The Recast.AI Entity is generated by the Recast.AI Sentence and provides the following methods:

* Name() *The name of the entity*
* Raw() *The raw text on which the entity was detected*

In addition to Name and Raw, more attributes can be accessed by the Field method which can be one of the following:

* hex
* value
* deg
* formated
* lng
* lat
* unit
* code
* person
* number
* gender
* next
* grain
* order

```go
response, _ := client.TextRequest("What's the weather in San Francisco?")
var location *recast.Entity
location = response.Entity("location")
if response.Intent() == "weather" && location != nil {
	fmt.Printf("You asked me for the weather in %s\n", location.Field("formated").(string))
}
```
***Recast.AI entity fields type are dependant on the entity itself so Field returns an interface{}, you must do a type assertion as follows:***
* Numbers: float64
* Strings: string

Refer to [Recast.Ai Entities Manual](https://man.recast.ai/#list-of-entities) for details about entities
